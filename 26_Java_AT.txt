- OOP  - Object oreinted Programming
     procedure/function oreinted programming  - C
     OOP - java
     Hybrid - C++ 

OOP concepts
 1. class
 2. Object
 3. Inheritance
 4. Encapsulation
 5. Polymorphisum
 6. Abstraction


class - It's is blueprint of an object.
        It is collection of objects.
        It has data members and member functions
        Vehical - no_of_wheels,engine , body_type,color,price 
                  drive
        Person - name,address,age,c_no,email.......
                 eat,speakm,walk - detailsPrint,getDetails

Object - Real entity 
      - It is type of class
	 - int num
     - Vehical scooter; 
     - Vehical car;
     -Person sangini;
    - Person dharmishtha;
   - object have a own data and member function

Student 
    name,c_no,total_marks,percentage
   getDetails()
   display()

Lab Task : 
Design and implement a simple Java program to manage basic information about employees.
Each employee has:
A name , An ID number , A salary
-------

Create Employee objects

Assign values to their attributes

Display employee information

second 

Create a simple Java program to represent a bank account.
Each bank account has:

An account holder’s name - An account number - A balance

create a class named BankAccount with:

Data members: accHolderName, accNumber, balance

Methods:

setDetails(String name, int number, double bal) → to assign values

deposit(double amount) → to add money to balance

withdraw(double amount) → to subtract money if balance is sufficient

displayInfo() → to display account details

Create a main class (Main) that:

Creates two BankAccount objects
Calls the above methods to demonstrate deposits and withdrawals
Withdraw money
Display account details


Third 

Create a Java program to represent books in a library or bookstore.
Each book has:

A title - An author -  A price - A quantity (number of copies available)

The program should:

Allow creating Book objects
Assign details using a method 
Display book information
Calculate and show the total value of all copies of a book (price × quantity)


11th Nov
   Constructor  -> 

void setDetails(String name,int accNumber1,float initBalance)
	{
		accHolderName=name;
		accNumber=accNumber1;
		balance=initBalance;
	}
  
to initilize accHolderName , accNumber , balance created method setDetails 


Rather then createing method we are createing constructor 

- To inilize object
- called automatically
- when object is created constructor is called
- constructor have a same name as class name
- one class have 1 or more constructor 
-Constructor doesn't have return type

-Each class have default construtor/no paramterize constructor 

BUT when we are using/creating paramterize constructor then we MUST have implement no argument constructor 


- Account / Book replace with construtor 

this - keyword 
    it is reference to current object 

3 - INHERITANCE
    Parent-child
    Property of one class can use property of another class 
    reusability
    super - keyword


Lab task : Read types of inheritance 
Lab task : BankAccounts create 5 objects using array 

int[] num=new int[5];
BankAccount obj[5];
obj[0]=new BankAccount("Ritesh",234,122222);
obj[1]=new BankAccount("Mayur",222,12222);
obj[2]=new BankAccount("Dharmsihtha",777,2222);

obj[2].display();

- Inheritance is self study 

polymorphisum  - one name many form 

Sangini - student , daughter , intern , friend , 

2 types 
1. Compile time/static binding / method overloading  
    - Method overloading means same method name but arguments are different 
      argument doen't match then gives compil time error.
      at the time of copilation will decide which method is called based on parameter
		addition(int ,int)
        addition(int,int,int)
        addition(int ,float)

  - overload constructor 
  class can have more then one cosntructor with arguments 

   main()
      addition(2,3,2);
	 addition(2.3,23); - error


2. run time/dynamic binding / method overriding
  - same method name and arguments are also same parent-child
 - you have 2 different classes
-super


Lab task : Constructor Overloading Book ,BankAccount(), - name,initBalance 
addition

OOPS 
   - class
	-object
 	Inheritance
	Polyphisum 
		Compile time Poly - eg method Overloading
		Runtime Poly - eg metho Overriding 	same method name same argument but here we are concept of inheritance 
		Shape - calculateArea()
		Rectangle uses Shape - calculateArea()
		Sqaure uses Shape - calculaArea()

Lab Task : Overrding Rectangle and Square Constructor

Polymorphisum

Create a class Shape with a method area().


Create subclasses:
Circle (with radius)


Rectangle (with width and height)
Override the area() method in each subclass.


Create a method printArea(Shape s) in a separate ShapeTest class that prints the area.


In main, call printArea() with both Circle and Rectangle.


2.Create a class Animal with a method makeSound() that prints "Some sound".


Create subclasses Dog and Cat that override makeSound() to print "Bark" and "Meow".


In your main method:


Create an array of Animal objects containing both Dog and Cat.


Loop through the array and call makeSound().


3. Create a base class Printer with a method print().

Create subclasses LaserPrinter and InkjetPrinter overriding print().

Add a method in the base class called testPrint(Printer p) that calls p.print().

In main, pass different subclass instances to testPrint().


4. Create an abstract class Shape with an abstract draw() method.


Create Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle classes.


Create a ShapeFactory class with a method getShape(String type) that returns a Shape.


In main, get different shapes from the factory and call draw()


5. Create a base class Player with a method attack().

Create subclasses Warrior, Archer, and Mage.

Each subclass overrides attack() with a unique message.

Create an array of Player and simulate a battle by calling attack() on each.


6. 
Create a base class Bank with method getInterestRate() → 5.

Create subclasses HDFCBank, ICICIBank, and SBIBank that override it with different rates.

In main, create objects of each and print the rate.

Next Abstraction 

17th nov

Method overriding -  same method name and same arguments 

Abstraction - sebsitive hide -
 - display only essential details and hidning other details.

1. abstract class
2. interface 

abstract class 
- have one or more abstract method
- abstract method and non abstract method 
- if method is abstract then it must be implement/overriding into subclass
- can not create object of abstract class 
- if class have one method as abstract then that class is abstract
-abstract methods doesn't have body

Interface 
- 100% abstract 
- all methods abstract methods 
- just declaration 
- implements not extends
- data in interface are public , final bydefault


Lab Task : 

Abstraction (polymorphism + Inheritance)
Create class Account with method calculateInterest().
Create subclasses:
SavingsAccount → returns 4%
CurrentAccount → returns 2%

Create an array of Account references and store both subclass objects.
Loop through and call calculateInterest().

2.
Create a base class Product with:
Fields: name, price
Method: displayDetails()


Subclasses:
Electronics → adds warrantyYears
Clothing → adds size
Override displayDetails() to include subclass info.
